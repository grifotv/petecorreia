Hey there, I'm Pete. <span data-anthro="howisday"></span>

I was born in sunny Portugal and studied at the University of Aveiro, where I got my Bachelor's degree in Information and Communication Technologies.

My career started in January 2009 before graduating when I got an **internship as a Front-end Developer at [SAPO Labs](http://labs.sapo.pt/)**, the research division of [SAPO](http://sapo.pt) ([Portugal Telecom](http://www.telecom.pt)). I helped build [SAPO Campus](http://campus.sapo.pt), which provided a set of social platforms like Photos, Videos and Blogs specifically tailored for universities. I relocated to Lisbon to **join [SAPO](http://sapo.pt)** full-time and in the couple of years that followed I worked on both their Blogs and News platforms, which were in the top 10 most visited portuguese websites.

I moved to London at the end October 2011 and **became [Pachube](http://www.haque.co.uk/pachube.php)'s first Front-end Developer**, right after the company got acquired by [LogMeIn Inc](https://logmein.com). I led the front-end development in the rebrand as Cosm in 2012. A year later, the company decided to rebrand once again as **[Xively by LogMeIn](https://xively.com)** but this time I was put in charge of the Design & Front-end team as Creative Director and Lead Front-end Developer. After a successful redesign, the product got important customers and partnerships, won industry awards and got featured in well-regarded international publications.

In September 2013, I **joined [Umbrellium](http://umbrellium.co.uk) to build innovative digital products**, with a team that included former Pachube colleagues. One of the products we created was **[Thingful](http://thingful.net), the world's first Internet of Things search engine**. I designed the identity, user experience and interface, and developed the front-end of the application for which we have a US Patent Pending. It got featured in [HBR](https://hbr.org/2014/10/the-internet-of-things-is-more-than-just-a-bunch-of-refrigerators/), [Wired](http://blog.thingful.net/post/85811252571/thingful-in-wireds-connective-ipad-kindle), [New Scientist](http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn24771-thingful-site-brings-linked-internet-of-things-to-life.html), [GigaOM](https://gigaom.com/2014/10/01/thingful-upgrades-its-search-engine-for-the-internet-of-things/), among others. At the same time, I developed the mobile application and server-side logic that powered the [Mini-Burble in Paris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjoumVT070A), an interactive light installation commissioned by Samsung.

{% include content/full-quote.html quote="I love digital products and the process of making them." %}

This passion has driven me to learn and work in different disciplines like branding, UX and UI design, and front-end development. Having an understanding of all that goes into crafting a product allows me to have a holistic approach to solving a problem. It also makes it easy to communicate with the various specialised teams.

In terms of front-end development, I've worked extensively with bleeding edge **HTML5 and CSS3**. I've been a fervent supporter of using [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) as a pre-processor. I've also been coding **Javascript for 6 years**, building my own frameworks and libraries and using popular ones like [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/). With Thingful, I had to dive deeply into online mapping libraries like [CartoDB.js](http://docs.cartodb.com/cartodb-platform/cartodb-js.html) and [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/). I used [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) and [Raphael.js](http://raphaeljs.com/) for creating visualisations while working for the News platform team at SAPO.
